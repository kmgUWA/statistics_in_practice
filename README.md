# Statistics in Practice Project

## Overview

The "Statistics in Practice" project aims to develop statistical analysis skills, enhance data interpretation abilities, and improve the presentation of findings for non-technical audiences. This collaborative project involves analyzing datasets and summarizing the results in a concise five-slide PowerPoint format. The primary focus is on applying linear regression to explore the relationship between various factors, including age, duration, commission, distribution channel, and claims, using insurance data for Asian countries.

## Project Details

### Dataset
- The project utilizes datasets related to insurance data for Asian countries. You can find specific dataset details in the accompanying information sheet provided in Excel.

### Objectives
- Enhance statistical analysis skills
- Interpret and communicate statistical output effectively to non-technical audiences

### Methodology
- The project employs linear regression to investigate the relationships between net sales and age, duration, commission, distribution channel, claims within the context of insurance data for Asian countries.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: We employed Microsoft Excel's data analysis tools for comprehensive data cleaning. This step included handling outliers, missing values, and formatting issues to ensure data quality.

- **Data Splitting**: Excel's formula features were utilized to split and organize the dataset, ensuring proper segmentation for analysis. 

- **Outlier Removal**: We conducted outlier detection and removal using Excel's built-in functions to improve data reliability.

## Data Analysis

- **Grouping Data**: Pivot tables in Microsoft Excel were employed to group and summarize data, facilitating a clearer understanding of patterns and trends within the dataset. 

- **Dummy Variables**: We created dummy variables to convert categorical data into a suitable format for analysis, enhancing the accuracy of our statistical models.

- **Correlation Matrix**: Excel's data analysis tools were utilized to calculate and visualize the correlation matrix, allowing us to explore relationships between variables effectively.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: We leveraged Microsoft Excel's powerful data analysis and manipulation capabilities to perform various data preprocessing and analysis tasks.



## Project Structure

- The project involves data analysis using MS-Excel and the creation of a concise five-slide PowerPoint presentation.
